<div class="history">
<p align="center">The multiple intelligences came from Gardner's Theory. Howard Gardner is a psychologist of developmental and a Professor at Harvard University Graduate School of Education in 1983.  This theory explains how human intelligence can be classified into different modalities: visual-spatial, verbal-linguistic, musical-rhythmic, logical-mathematical, interpersonal, intrapersonal, naturalistic, and bodily-kinesthetic. Howard Gardner stated that each person has various levels of potential and intelligence in their interests.</p>
