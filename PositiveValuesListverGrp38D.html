<OL type="I">
<LI><b>Faith in the Creator -</b> Belief in a divine being who created life and miracles. An act of perseverance, loyalty, and faith. Believing in something our eyes can’t see.
<LI><b>Love for One’s Country -</b> An emotion of deep affection and attachment towards one’s mother country. It involves pride in one’s culture, history, and traditions and a sense of responsibility to uphold the values and principles that define one's ethnicity.
<LI><b>Discipline and Orderliness -</b>  responsibility, self-control, and respect, leading to improved organization, efficiency, and a more successful and fulfilling life.
<LI><b<Respect for Self and Others -</b> When we respect ourselves and others, we create a positive and harmonious environment that fosters healthy relationships and enhances overall well-being. Respect also helps in building self-esteem, self-confidence, and a sense of self-worth, which are crucial for success in all aspects of life.
<LI><b>Concern for Others -</b> consider the needs and difficulties of others and take an active interest in their feelings, capabilities, and perspectives to assist them with the difficulties they face and act with integrity, warmth, and concern.
<LI><b>Integrity and Honesty -</b> Honesty and integrity are crucial elements in developing trust and strong relationships. Honesty means being truthful and transparent in one's actions and words, while integrity is adhering to a strong moral code and principles. Together, they create the foundation for trust and mutual respect in relationships.
<LI><b>Collaboration and Commitment to One’s Work -</b> Collaborative Commitments are a series of questions or sentence starters to guide your team as you clarify how you’ll work together. You can use them anytime you’re getting ready to start something new—a new fiscal year, a new project, a new team member coming on board, you get the picture. Think of it as a proactive level-setting that will set you up for success, which is much better than being in reactive/repair mode. 
<LI><b>Productivity, Responsibility, and Perseverance -</b> It is what helps us work through the smaller obstacles that can ultimately derail a career path. Perseverance means going through the sometimes frustrating process of working through technical issues, continuing to grapple with tough course material, and completing projects when there is every possible distraction. It will mean attempting to resolve issues with challenging co-workers, spending time researching a case or file, and being able to stay focused on long-term goals such as a promotion.
