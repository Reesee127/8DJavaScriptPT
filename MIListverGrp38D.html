<h3 style="color:#b30000"> History </h3>
The multiple intelligences came from Gardner's Theory. Howard Gardner is a psychologist of developmental and a Professor at Harvard University Graduate School of Education in 1983. This theory explains how human intelligence can be classified into different modalities: visual-spatial, verbal-linguistic, musical-rhythmic, logical-mathematical, interpersonal, intrapersonal, naturalistic,c, and bodily-kinesthetic. Howard Gardner stated that each person has various levels of potential and intelligence in their interests.

<h3 style="color:0047b3"> The List of MI Intelligences </h3>   
	<ul>
    	<li><b>Interpersonal Intelligence -</b> It is the ability to understand others as you understand yourself. Recognizing and relating to others leads to an impeccable social life. It involves recognizing and responding to the feelings, moods, motivations, and intentions of others. This intelligence is crucial for building strong relationships and navigating social situations. Most say that to be a great leader is to be interpersonally intelligent.
<li><b>Intrapersonal -</b> the ability to understand oneself, including one's thoughts, feelings, motivations, and behavior. It involves self-awareness, introspection, and the capacity to use this self-knowledge to make decisions. Understanding oneself is a crucial step to understanding others.
<li><b>Verbal/Linguistic -</b> It is the ability to comprehend and productively explain ideas through words and create spoken language. People who are considered verbal-linguistic intelligence are skilled in reading, writing, listening, and communicating.
<li><b>Musical -</b> It is the ability to understand and produce musical skills such as rhythm, patterns, and lyrics. This enables people being able to create, communicate, and comprehend definitions through sounds. People with musical intelligence have a strong potential and aptitude for learning and playing musical instruments, and they also have an excellent sense of rhythm.
<li><b>Body-Kinesthetic -</b> This is the ability to manipulate our body to express our emotions, create an action, or to use our body to explore new things. This involves a sense of time response and the excellence of skills through mind-body union <i>(The University of Tennessee Health Science Center, n.d.).</i>
<li><b>Logical/Mathematical -</b> This refers to the ability to understand or solve numerical patterns and to think logically, reason, and identify connections. People with logical-mathematical intelligence may excel in executing mathematical operations.
<li><b>Naturalist -</b>  the ability to recognize and categorize patterns in the natural world, including plants, animals, and other environmental elements. It involves sensitivity for the natural world, appreciation for its beauty, and a keen understanding of how species relate to each other. Individuals with strong naturalistic intelligence often have a strong interest in nature and are drawn to careers related to the environment or natural sciences. 
<li><b>Visual/Spatial -</b> It is the ability to understand and perceive visual trends, visualize shapes and objects, and observe images and diagrams. This intelligence is commonly found among people who excel as architects, drafters, artists, and engineers. The use of representations to perform activities is often considered visual-spatial intelligence.
